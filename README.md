Build on your PC:
This Numeric Sequence Calculator application is developed in Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate edition. It is using Nuget packages which are configured to be restored on the build of the solution.
If you face issues with packages not restoring, you can open the Package Manager Console and restore the packages. 
If you need me to push packages to the repository, please let me know by emailing "adnan.akbar@live.com".

Running MVC Web App:
Make sure project "NumericSequenceCalculator.Web" is set as a start up project. Then start the application with / without debugging.
This will open the home page with text boxes to enter the positive whole numbers and click on the respective buttons to get the number sequence results.

Running Test:
Business Unit test should work seamlessly, however for UI Coded test (NumericSequenceCalculator.Web.Test), make sure Internet Explorer is configured in visual studio to run. These UI Coded tests are only supported in Visual Studio Premium / Ultimate versions.
